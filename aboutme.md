Hi, you can call me Dan. I'm currently a researcher of experimental nuclear physics working as a postdoc at University of Masschusetts Lowell. This means I build detector systems, run nuclear reaction simulations and calcuations, and travel to accelerator facilities around the U.S. (and hopefully internationally soon).

In my free time I play video games, write short stories (you can check a few out [here](/stuff/)), draw, and other stuff. You can also check out my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/chronobro) to see what I've been up to.
