## Research Interests:
Searching for physics Beyond the Standard Model using nuclear spectroscopic techniques. Understanding nuclear structure and dynamics through scattering experiments. Developing state-of-the-art neutron detectors for use throughout nuclear science. Understanding astrophysical processes through a nuclear lens, for example, isotopic abundances generated in neutron-star mergers. Studying the implications of different nuclear equations of state (EOS) on dense matter.
