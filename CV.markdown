# Relevant Skills:

Programming skills in C++ and ROOT. These programming skills have been applied to analyzing large data sets and constructing nuclear scattering simulations to determine geometrical efficiency and resolution of detector systems. Proficient in 3D-CAD programs, in particular, Autodesk Inventor. 

# Teaching Statement:
I want to foster a culture of learning and excitement for science, while also involving students in state-of-the-art experiments. 

# Research Interests:
Searching for physics Beyond the Standard Model using nuclear spectroscopic techniques. Understanding nuclear structure and dynamics through scattering experiments. Developing state-of-the-art neutron detectors for use throughout nuclear science. Understanding astrophysical processes through a nuclear lens, for example, isotopic abundances generated in neutron-star mergers. Studying the implications of different nuclear equations of state (EOS) on dense matter.
